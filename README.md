## 📋 Project Overview

The project involves implementing two algorithms with the aim of automatically labeling images from a clothing catalog based on color and clothing type criteria.

### 🎨 K-Means Algorithm

Initially, we implemented the K-Means algorithm, an unsupervised learning algorithm that extracts the most representative colors from an image.

### 👚 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

Next, we implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a supervised learning algorithm that, based on a training set of images, predicts the type of clothing in an image.

### 🔧 Modifications and Code Study

Finally, we modified these algorithms and conducted a study of the code.
